# Video-Popularoty-Challenge
## What is the goal?
The goal of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the number of views that videos are likely to receive based on attributes such as duration, language, the number of likes, and the day of the week.

## Why predict video popularity?
Besides this algorithm simply being a cool application of data science, video creators want to know how to give their videos the best chance of going viral. If they can improve their chances by publishing their video at a certain time of day or with a certain title, they can improve their chances of being seen by a wider audience.

Also, on the company side, video hosting platforms could use such a prediction algorithm to determine which videos have the potential for high levels of popularity. This can help the video platform effectively price ads on those videos, because they wouldnâ€™t want to place pricey ads on videos that no one would watch.
